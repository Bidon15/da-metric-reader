# Terminal Output Example

## Startup

```
üöÄ Listening for OTLP/HTTP on http://0.0.0.0:4318
üìä Sampler will tick every 30 seconds
üì¶ Batches will be generated every 3600 seconds
üîÑ Sampler started (tick every 30s, window size: 120)
üì¶ Batch generator started (every 3600s)
```

## When Metrics Are Received

```
üì• Received metrics - DAS metrics updated successfully
```

## Every 30 Seconds (Sample Tick)

### Successful Sample

```
‚úÖ Sample OK - Head: Some(12345) (+2), Headers: Some(98765) | Buffer: 45/120 samples
```

This shows:

- Head value increased by 2 blocks
- Current header count
- Buffer has 45 samples out of 120 max

### Failed Sample

```
‚ùå Sample FAILED - head not advanced (prev: Some(12345), curr: Some(12345)) | Head: Some(12345), Headers: Some(98770)
```

## Timeline Example (First 2 Minutes)

00:00 üìä Sampler will tick every 30 seconds

00:15 üì• Received metrics - DAS metrics updated successfully
00:30 ‚úÖ Sample OK - Head: Some(100) (+2), Headers: Some(500) | Buffer: 1/120 samples

00:45 üì• Received metrics - DAS metrics updated successfully
01:00 ‚úÖ Sample OK - Head: Some(102) (+2), Headers: Some(510) | Buffer: 2/120 samples

01:15 üì• Received metrics - DAS metrics updated successfully

## What Each Component Means

### üì• Metrics Received

- Triggered when OTLP endpoint receives metrics from your DAS node
- Only shows if DAS-specific metrics (`das_sampled_chain_head`, `das_total_sampled_headers`) are present
- Indicates fresh data is being ingested

### ‚úÖ Sample OK

- **Head: Some(X)** - Current block height being sampled
- **(+N)** - How many blocks advanced since last sample (should be ‚â•1)
- **Headers: Some(Y)** - Total headers sampled count
- **Buffer: X/Y samples** - How many samples in the rolling window

### ‚ùå Sample FAILED

Shows specific reason for failure:

- `stale (age > 120s)` - Metrics too old
- `head not advanced` - Block height didn't increase
- `headers not advanced` - Header count didn't increase

### üì¶ Batch Generation

- Happens every `window_secs` (default 3600s = 1 hour)
- Shows detailed statistics and what would be posted to Celestia DA
- Clearly indicates if uptime threshold is met (‚úÖ) or not (‚ùå)

## Celestia Block Alignment

With **30-second ticks**:

- Celestia blocks: ~12-15 seconds
- Our samples: every 30 seconds
- **Result**: We sample every ~2 Celestia blocks ‚úÖ

This ensures we catch any DA issues quickly while avoiding excessive sampling.

## Quick Health Check

**Healthy System:**

```
‚úÖ Sample OK - Head: Some(12345) (+2), Headers: Some(98765) | Buffer: 45/120 samples
‚úÖ Sample OK - Head: Some(12347) (+2), Headers: Some(98770) | Buffer: 46/120 samples
‚úÖ Sample OK - Head: Some(12349) (+2), Headers: Some(98775) | Buffer: 47/120 samples
```

**Unhealthy System:**

```
‚ùå Sample FAILED - head not advanced (prev: Some(12345), curr: Some(12345)) | Head: Some(12345), Headers: Some(98765)
‚ùå Sample FAILED - stale (age > 120s) | Head: Some(12345), Headers: Some(98765)
‚ùå Sample FAILED - headers not advanced (prev: Some(98765), curr: Some(98765)) | Head: Some(12347), Headers: Some(98765)
```

## Files Generated

All files are written to the `data/` directory:

- `samples.json` - Every sample with timestamps and OK/FAILED status
- `batch.json` - Batch metadata (updated every hour)
- `bitmap.hex` - Hex-encoded bitmap of all samples (updated every hour)
