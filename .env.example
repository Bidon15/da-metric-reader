# Copy this file to .env and fill in your credentials

# Option 1: Mnemonic phrase (24 words)
# Recommended for development - automatically converted to private key
# IMPORTANT: Use quotes around the mnemonic because it contains spaces!
CELESTIA_MNEMONIC="your twenty four word mnemonic phrase goes here with spaces between each word"

# Option 2: Direct private key hex (64 characters)
# Use this if you already have the private key
# CELESTIA_PRIVATE_KEY="393fdb5def075819de55756b45c9e2c8531a8c78dd6eede483d3440e9457d839"
